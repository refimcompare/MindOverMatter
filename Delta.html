  <p>Preliminary .</p>
    The subsequent interview took place in WDA-302, A medium-security campus approximately 500 meters nadir of the general perimeter of area-99. The in-room camera recorded the total 450 minutes allotted time as allowed for code-white processing. The full 27,000 seconds are available at request alongside the transcript itself. This document serves as a heavily abridged version to facilitate interdepartmental coordination.

The Unquantifiable Phenomenon Centerpoint, henceforth referred to as UPC-ADX was engaged in the re-interview process willingly as a part of routine examinations. They presented their usual relaxed and laid-back disposition throughout the entire course. The provided psychologist panel judges that UPC-ADX answered questions truthfully and in good faith.

Further investigation into the true nature of UPC-ADX is ongoing. As of September 2009 there has been no development on the true validity or conclusiveness of ‘Benny’ or associated phenomena
